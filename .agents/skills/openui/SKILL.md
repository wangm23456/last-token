# OpenUI

OpenUI is a full-stack Generative UI framework centered on **OpenUI Lang**, a compact, streaming-first language for model-generated UI. Do not treat OpenUI as React-only: the core language, parser, prompt generation, runtime evaluation, and types live in `@openuidev/lang-core`; React, Vue, Svelte, and no-build browser integrations sit on top of that core.

Work from the user's app or project first. Inspect installed packages, generated templates, and lockfiles before giving API advice. When installed source is missing or the task targets `latest`, use only first-party OpenUI sources: the GitHub repo at `https://github.com/thesysdev/openui` and docs at `https://www.openui.com`.

## First Checks Before Answering

1. Inspect the user's project `package.json` and lockfile when available.
2. Identify which `@openuidev/*` packages and versions are installed.
3. Prefer installed package exports and generated templates over assumptions.
4. Use installed `node_modules/@openuidev/*`, `.d.ts` files, and generated files as the source of truth when available.
5. If no app or installed package exists, use first-party docs and GitHub source.

Do not use this skill for general React UI questions, generic design system advice, unrelated AI agent harnesses, or general frontend debugging unless OpenUI or `@openuidev` packages are involved.

## Current Package Map

| Package | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `@openuidev/lang-core` | Framework-agnostic parser, streaming parser, prompt generation, runtime evaluation, `Query`/`Mutation`, stores, bindings, JSON schema/types |
| `@openuidev/react-lang` | React `defineComponent`, `createLibrary`, `<Renderer />`, hooks, parser/prompt re-exports |
| `@openuidev/vue-lang` | Vue 3 `defineComponent`, `createLibrary`, `<Renderer />`, composables, parser re-exports |
| `@openuidev/svelte-lang` | Svelte 5 `defineComponent`, `createLibrary`, `<Renderer />`, context helpers, parser re-exports |
| `@openuidev/react-ui` | OpenUI's default React component libraries (`openuiLibrary`, `openuiChatLibrary`), `AgentInterface`, chat layouts, standalone UI primitives, styles, theming, and re-exports of `@openuidev/react-headless` APIs |
| `@openuidev/react-headless` | Bring-your-own React chat state, hooks, storage/LLM adapter primitives, streaming adapters, message converters, and artifact primitives without OpenUI's visual components |
| `@openuidev/react-email` | React Email component library and prompt options for generated email |
| `@openuidev/browser-bundle` | CDN/iframe/no-build React renderer bundle exposed as `window.__OpenUI` |
| `@openuidev/cli` | `openui create` scaffolding and `openui generate` prompt/schema generation from a library export |
| `@openuidev/thesys` | Version-sensitive client-side OpenUI Cloud helpers such as `useOpenuiCloudStorage()`, Cloud component sets, and Cloud artifact components/renderers/categories; verify current exports |
| `@openuidev/thesys-server` | Version-sensitive server-side OpenUI Cloud helpers such as `artifactTool` and `createResponsesInstructions` for Cloud-backed `/api/chat` routes |

Choose the package for the target runtime. For backend-only parsing or prompt/schema generation, prefer `@openuidev/lang-core` or the CLI instead of pulling in a UI framework.

`@openuidev/react-ui` re-exports the `@openuidev/react-headless` surface, so React UI apps can import adapters, message formats, storage helpers, hooks, and message types from `@openuidev/react-ui`. Keep `@openuidev/react-headless` as the direct import when building a custom/headless chat UI without OpenUI's visual components.

## Choose The Starting Point

- If the user wants a new OpenUI/GenUI app, use `@openuidev/cli`; it is the easiest scaffolding path.
- If the user wants to integrate OpenUI into an existing React/Next agent or chat app and wants an out-of-box component library, use `@openuidev/react-ui` with `AgentInterface`, `openuiLibrary`, or `openuiChatLibrary`.
- If the user wants OpenUI Lang rendering in an existing React project without the full React UI surface, use `@openuidev/react-lang`.
- If the host app is Vue or Svelte, use `@openuidev/vue-lang` or `@openuidev/svelte-lang`. Use `@openuidev/lang-core` for framework-agnostic parsing, prompt generation, schemas, or backend/runtime work.

## Route Cloud Integration and Migration Tasks

Inspect the target project's framework and router, package manifest and lockfile, server runtime, authentication, existing OpenUI imports, chat transport, storage, component library, tools, and artifacts. Preserve its package manager, route conventions, auth boundary, design system, and working behavior.

Choose the matching path:

| Starting point and goal                                                   | Required runbook                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Existing React app, add managed Cloud chat                                | Read [references/cloud-integration.md](references/cloud-integration.md) completely before editing                                                                         |
| Existing non-React app, add managed Cloud chat                            | Read [references/cloud-integration.md](references/cloud-integration.md); require a current first-party client/runtime or report the verified React-only boundary          |
| Existing self-hosted/open-source app, replace or supplement it with Cloud | Read both [references/oss-to-cloud-migration.md](references/oss-to-cloud-migration.md) and [references/cloud-integration.md](references/cloud-integration.md) completely before editing |

If “migrate” does not establish whether Cloud should replace the self-hosted path or run beside it, infer the intent from the project and request. Ask only when the choice remains material and ambiguous; never silently delete a working backend. Treat code migration and historical-data import as separate tasks, and do not claim a data migration without a verified first-party import API.

## Common Workflows

### Scaffold

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create --name genui-chat-app --template openui-self-hosted --no-skill --no-interactive
cd genui-chat-app
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" > .env
npm run dev
```

The CLI is the easiest way to scaffold a new OpenUI/GenUI app. Version-sensitive: verify current CLI flags/template names before relying on them. It prompts for an OpenUI Cloud or self-hosted Agent Interface app when no template is passed. Use `--template openui-cloud` for the managed Cloud starter and `--template openui-self-hosted` for the app-owned model/storage starter. For unattended agent/CI use, pass `--template`, `--no-interactive`, and usually `--no-skill`.

Use `--no-install` when the agent needs to control package-manager behavior explicitly:

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest create --name genui-chat-app --template openui-self-hosted --no-skill --no-interactive --no-install
```

If scaffold install/build fails with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` for native packages such as `sharp` or `unrs-resolver`, do not treat the scaffold as broken. Run `pnpm approve-builds` or `pnpm approve-builds --all`, then rerun install/build in an environment where package build scripts are allowed. Use first-party GitHub examples for Vue, Svelte, React Native, LangGraph, Mastra, Supabase, Vercel AI SDK, and other integrations.

For self-hosted template build checks, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` even if no real model call is made. The generated Next route creates the OpenAI client at module scope, so `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test pnpm run build` is a valid smoke test when no real request will be sent.

### Choose OpenUI Cloud or self-hosted

OpenUI Cloud is the managed backend for Agent Interface. It uses the open-source OpenUI rendering engine and adds production layers: persisted conversations, production-grade generative UI, prebuilt report/presentation artifacts, theming/white-labeling, output correction, model/provider resilience, versioning, observability, and audit trails.

Use Cloud when the user wants managed production infrastructure for an Agent Interface app. Use self-hosted OpenUI when the user wants to own the model route, storage, tools, component library, and runtime behavior.

Version-sensitive: verify exact Cloud template env vars, `@openuidev/thesys*` exports, and route helpers against the installed package/template. The CLI quickstart prompts for **OpenUI Cloud or self-hosted**. For Cloud:

- Store `THESYS_API_KEY` server-side only, typically in `.env.local`.
- The Cloud CLI template also uses `OPENUI_MODEL` in `provider/model` form and `DEMO_USER_ID` for the demo user identity.
- Keep Cloud calls behind server routes such as `/api/chat` and `/api/frontend-token`; never expose the server key to the browser.
- In the `openui-cloud` template, `/api/chat` uses `@openuidev/thesys-server` helpers such as `artifactTool` and `createResponsesInstructions`.
- `AgentInterface` connects to Cloud with `llm` and `storage` props. `llm` points to an app route that proxies Cloud's Responses endpoint, usually with `openAIResponsesAdapter()` and `openAIConversationMessageFormat`. `storage` uses `useOpenuiCloudStorage()` from `@openuidev/thesys` with a short-lived frontend token.
- Cloud-provided component sets, artifact renderers, and categories come from `@openuidev/thesys`.
- Generate keys in the Thesys console: `https://console.thesys.dev/keys`.

For existing-project Cloud work, keep these invariants intact:

- Keep the two Cloud planes separate: `ChatLLM` posts to the app's `/api/chat` proxy, while `useOpenuiCloudStorage()` accesses Cloud storage with a short-lived token minted by `/api/frontend-token`.
- Send only the latest message with `openAIConversationMessageFormat.toApi(messages.slice(-1))`; Cloud replays history from `conversation: threadId`. Pair that format with `openAIResponsesAdapter()`.
- Derive the frontend token's `user_id` from authenticated server state in production. Authenticate and rate-limit both routes independently, treat `threadId` as untrusted, and authorize it through a verified host mapping or documented Cloud membership check for the installed version. Do not assume the installed SDK exports an ownership helper.
- Do not deploy a demo identity unchanged. Replace it with host authentication, rate limiting, and conversation authorization; disable both routes and report the blocker until those controls exist.
- In Next.js, isolate `@openuidev/thesys` imports in a client component and follow the installed first-party template's dynamic-rendering boundary. If the production build still evaluates browser-only dependencies during prerender, add a small `dynamic(..., { ssr: false })` client loader.
- Preserve abort propagation and close the SSE stream when the upstream stream ends.
- Do not invent a Cloud history-import API, custom-tool execution loop, or custom-library instruction API. Verify current first-party support and preserve the self-hosted path when a required capability is unsupported.

### Wire Agent Interface

Use `AgentInterface` from `@openuidev/react-ui` for the full chat surface. It owns the layout, sidebar, thread list, composer, routing, and workspace rail. Configure the backend through two independent channels:

- `llm` is required. Use `fetchLLM({ url, streamAdapter, messageFormat })` for normal HTTP POST routes.
- `storage` is optional. Omit it for in-memory conversations; use `restStorage({ baseUrl })` or Cloud storage for persisted threads and artifacts.
- Optional props include `artifactRenderers`, `artifactCategories`, `componentLibrary`, `components`, theme/branding, starters, routing, and children/slots.

`AgentInterface` is a full app shell, not automatically a compact embedded widget. It measures its own container, switches to mobile layout below 768px, and still renders shell chrome unless slots override it. For a narrow assistant rail around 390px, prefer `Renderer` plus `openuiChatLibrary` when the host owns the chat layout; if using `AgentInterface`, replace slots such as `Sidebar`, `ThreadHeader`, `Composer`, or `Workspace` and scope CSS overrides to a host wrapper around `.openui-agent-*`.

```tsx
import {
  AgentInterface,
  fetchLLM,
  restStorage,
  openAIReadableStreamAdapter,
  openAIMessageFormat,
} from "@openuidev/react-ui";

const llm = fetchLLM({
  url: "/api/chat",
  streamAdapter: openAIReadableStreamAdapter(),
  messageFormat: openAIMessageFormat,
});

const storage = restStorage({ baseUrl: "/api/chat/storage" });

export function Chat() {
  return <AgentInterface llm={llm} storage={storage} />;
}
```

`fetchLLM` talks only to the app's own route and posts `{ threadId, messages }`; the provider API key stays server-side in that route. The route must return a streaming `Response` that the selected adapter can parse. Call adapter factories, for example `agUIAdapter()`, `openAIAdapter()`, `openAIReadableStreamAdapter()`, `openAIResponsesAdapter()`, or `langGraphAdapter()`, and pair them with the matching message format when one is needed.

There are two valid `llm` wiring patterns:

- Use `fetchLLM({ url, streamAdapter, messageFormat })` for ordinary POST-to-route integrations. The option is named `streamAdapter`.
- Implement `ChatLLM` directly when the scaffold or app needs custom transport. Direct `ChatLLM` objects use `streamProtocol`, not `streamAdapter`.

```ts
import { type ChatLLM, openAIAdapter } from "@openuidev/react-ui";

const llm: ChatLLM = {
  streamProtocol: openAIAdapter(),
  send: ({ threadId, messages, signal }) =>
    fetch("/api/chat", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ threadId, messages }),
      signal,
    }),
};
```

### Integrate into existing apps

- Version-sensitive: when adding React UI to an existing React app, inspect installed `@openuidev/*` peer ranges and package-manager errors; add direct peers only when they are missing or incompatible.
- Next.js App Router: render `Renderer` or `AgentInterface` from a client component; add `"use client"` at the top of the file that imports or renders them.
- Next.js with OpenUI Cloud: keep Cloud imports in a separate client module, retain the existing server page/layout for host authentication and product shell concerns, and verify the installed template's dynamic-rendering pattern with a production build.
- Vite or strict TypeScript: before side-effect CSS imports, ensure the app has `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` or a declaration such as `declare module "*.css";`.
- Import React UI CSS once, normally `@openuidev/react-ui/components.css` plus `@openuidev/react-ui/styles/index.css`; use `@openuidev/react-ui/layered/styles/index.css` when the app needs cascade-layered overrides.
- Examples/docs may import adapters from `@openuidev/react-headless`; React UI apps can also import those adapters from `@openuidev/react-ui` because it re-exports headless APIs.

For an existing chat app that already owns message state, render only assistant GenUI responses with `Renderer` and `openuiChatLibrary`:

```tsx
import { Renderer } from "@openuidev/react-lang";
import { openuiChatLibrary } from "@openuidev/react-ui";
import "@openuidev/react-ui/components.css";
import "@openuidev/react-ui/styles/index.css";

export function AssistantGenUI({
  response,
  isStreaming,
}: {
  response: string;
  isStreaming?: boolean;
}) {
  return (
    <Renderer
      response={response}
      library={openuiChatLibrary}
      isStreaming={isStreaming}
      onError={(error) => console.error(error)}
    />
  );
}
```

For compact side rails, prompt generated OpenUI output toward one-column `Card`/`Stack` layouts, short lists, concise sections, and narrow-safe tables. Avoid row-wrapped metric cards, multi-column grids, wide tables, and dense charts inside a 390px rail unless the chosen component is explicitly responsive.

### Start from examples

OpenUI publishes first-party examples at `https://github.com/thesysdev/openui/tree/main/examples`. Use these examples as implementation references before inventing a new integration pattern:

- Starters and apps: `openui-chat`, `openui-dashboard`, `openui-artifact-demo`.
- Agent/chat integrations: `vercel-ai-chat`, `langgraph-chat`, `mastra-chat`, `multi-agent-chat`, `supabase-chat`, `fastapi-backend`.
- Framework/runtime examples: `vue-chat`, `svelte-chat`, `openui-react-native`, `react-email`.
- Third-party UI/component examples: `material-ui-chat`, `shadcn-chat`, `form-generator`, `hands-on-table-chat`.
- Harnesses: `harnesses/pi-agent-harness`, `harnesses/vercel-eve`.

### Generate a prompt or schema

```bash
npx @openuidev/cli@latest generate ./src/library.tsx --out ./src/generated/system-prompt.txt
npx @openuidev/cli@latest generate ./src/library.tsx --json-schema --out ./src/generated/component-spec.json
```

The target module must export a library with `prompt()` and `toJSONSchema()`. By default the CLI looks for `library`, then `default`, then any matching export. It can also auto-detect prompt options from `promptOptions`, `options`, or an export ending in `PromptOptions`.

### Use OpenUI's built-in libraries first

OpenUI ships its own default component libraries. Do not tell users they need a separate third-party component library just to get started.

- Use `openuiLibrary` for the general-purpose default library: charts, tables, forms, cards, images, layout, modals, tabs, and related UI.
- Use `openuiChatLibrary` for chat responses: a `Card` root plus chat-oriented components like follow-ups, steps, callouts, list blocks, and section blocks.
- Define a custom library only when the app needs domain-specific components or a non-React runtime that cannot use the React UI package directly.

```ts
import { openuiLibrary, openuiPromptOptions } from "@openuidev/react-ui";

const systemPrompt = openuiLibrary.prompt(openuiPromptOptions);
```

### Define or extend a custom library

Use the runtime package that matches the app when adding custom components or building a runtime-specific library:

- Install `zod` if the host project does not already have it.
- Use `.tsx` for React library files that contain JSX; reserve `.ts` for non-JSX libraries.
- To integrate third-party React component libraries such as Material UI, wrap their components in `defineComponent`; the OpenUI schema still comes from `zod/v4`, and the renderer can return any valid React element.

```tsx
import { createLibrary, defineComponent } from "@openuidev/react-lang";
import { z } from "zod/v4";

const MetricCard = defineComponent({
  name: "MetricCard",
  description: "Shows a labeled metric.",
  props: z.object({
    label: z.string(),
    value: z.string(),
  }),
  component: ({ props }) => (
    <article>
      <strong>{props.label}</strong>
      <span>{props.value}</span>
    </article>
  ),
});

export const library = createLibrary({
  root: "MetricCard",
  components: [MetricCard],
});
```

Adapt `component` to the target runtime:

- React: render a React component/function from `@openuidev/react-lang`.
- Vue: pass a Vue component from `@openuidev/vue-lang`.
- Svelte: pass a Svelte component from `@openuidev/svelte-lang`.
- Framework-agnostic prompt/schema work: use `@openuidev/lang-core` and store an opaque renderer value such as `null` when no UI renderer is needed.

Use `zod/v4` for component schemas. Zod object key order defines OpenUI Lang positional argument order, so put required and distinctive props first and optional props last.

## OpenUI Lang Rules

Version-sensitive: verify the current OpenUI Lang spec before relying on syntax details. OpenUI Lang v0.5 is assignment-based and line-oriented:

```text
identifier = Expression
```

Core rules:

- Write one statement per line.
- Always define `root = <RootComponent>(...)`; no `root` means nothing renders.
- Put the `root` statement first for streaming, then define children/data below it.
- Use positional arguments only: `Stack([title], "row", "l")`, not named arguments.
- Forward references are allowed: `root = Stack([chart])` can appear before `chart = ...`.
- Component arguments map to props by Zod schema key order.
- Optional positional args may be omitted from the end.
- Use double-quoted strings in examples and prompts.

Example:

```text
root = Stack([title, metrics, table])
title = TextContent("Q4 dashboard", "large-heavy")
metrics = Stack([rev, users], "row", "m")
rev = StatCard("Revenue", "$1.2M")
users = StatCard("Users", "450k")
table = Table([Col("Region", ["NA", "EU"]), Col("Revenue", [720000, 480000], "currency")])
```

## v0.5 Runtime Features

Use these only when the generated prompt/library enables the feature.

### Reactive state

Declare state with `$name = defaultValue`. Passing a `$variable` into a reactive/binding prop creates two-way binding. In the built-in React UI library, generated signatures are the truth source; for example `Input` and `Select` expose `value?: $binding<...>` near the end of their argument lists.

```text
$days = "7"
root = Stack([filter, total])
filter = Select("days", [SelectItem("7", "7 days"), SelectItem("30", "30 days")], null, null, $days)
total = TextContent("Showing " + $days + " days")
```

### Query and Mutation

`Query` reads data on load and refreshes when referenced `$variables` in its args change. `Mutation` is inert until triggered.

```text
$title = ""
root = Stack([input, btn, tbl])
todos = Query("list_todos", {}, {rows: []})
createTodo = Mutation("create_todo", {title: $title})
input = Input("title", "What needs to be done?", "text", null, $title)
btn = Button("Create", Action([@Run(createTodo), @Run(todos), @Reset($title)]), "primary")
tbl = Table([Col("Title", todos.rows.title)])
```

Queries and mutations must be top-level statements, not inline component arguments.

### Built-ins and actions

Built-ins require `@`; bare names such as `Count(...)` are invalid. Common built-ins include `@Count`, `@Sum`, `@Avg`, `@Min`, `@Max`, `@First`, `@Last`, `@Filter`, `@Sort`, `@Round`, `@Each`, `@Run`, `@Set`, `@Reset`, `@ToAssistant`, and `@OpenUrl`.

## Renderer Notes

Use the renderer from the target framework package:

- React: `import { Renderer } from "@openuidev/react-lang"`
- Vue: `import { Renderer } from "@openuidev/vue-lang"`
- Svelte: `import { Renderer } from "@openuidev/svelte-lang"`
- Browser bundle: use `window.__OpenUI.Renderer` with `window.__OpenUI.openuiChatLibrary`

Renderer props commonly include `response`, `library`, `isStreaming`, `onAction`, `onStateUpdate`, `initialState`, and `onParseResult`. React also supports `toolProvider`, `queryLoader`, and `onError` for `Query`/`Mutation` workflows and automated correction loops.

During streaming, unresolved forward refs are expected. After the stream ends, inspect parser/renderer errors for unknown components, missing required props, excess args, inline `Query`/`Mutation`, runtime errors, or unresolved refs.

Version-sensitive: verify renderer props against installed exports; there is no current `nodePlaceholder` renderer prop in the inspected source.

## Verification

- Run `openui generate` against the library file before using a custom library in an app.
- Run the host app's TypeScript/build checks after existing-app integrations, especially when adding React UI CSS imports or Next client components.
- Validate canned OpenUI Lang with `createParser(...).parse(...)` and inspect `result.meta.errors`; do not look for top-level `result.errors`.
- Treat parse/runtime errors surfaced through `Renderer` `onError` or parser results as LLM-correctable feedback: unknown components, missing required props, excess positional args, inline `Query`/`Mutation`, runtime errors, or unresolved refs should be fed back into the next model turn.
- For Cloud, confirm the server key never appears in client code, the client sends only the latest message, the adapter/format pair matches, and the frontend token uses a scoped authenticated identity.
- Test invalid request bodies and provider-item injection, missing configuration, upstream failures, abort handling, and stream closure without a real key when possible.
- Verify logged-out requests cannot use either Cloud route and one authenticated user cannot address another user's conversation id.
- With an authorized test key, smoke-test streaming, reload persistence, user isolation, and one managed report or presentation artifact.
- Vite large chunk warnings from default React UI/chat libraries are not automatically failures; chart/UI dependencies can be substantial.
- For scoped agent tests, keep caches/stores inside the assigned workspace when needed, for example `npm_config_cache=$PWD/.npm-cache npm install` or `pnpm install --store-dir .pnpm-store`.

```ts
import { createParser } from "@openuidev/react-lang";
import { openuiChatLibrary } from "@openuidev/react-ui";

const parser = createParser(openuiChatLibrary.toJSONSchema(), "Card");
const result = parser.parse(response);
const errors = result.meta?.errors ?? [];
if (errors.length > 0) throw new Error(JSON.stringify(errors, null, 2));
```

Use root `"Card"` for `openuiChatLibrary`, `"Stack"` for `openuiLibrary`, and the configured custom root for custom libraries.

## Built-in Libraries and Styles

For the default React component library, use `@openuidev/react-ui`:

```ts
import { Renderer } from "@openuidev/react-lang";
import { openuiLibrary, openuiPromptOptions } from "@openuidev/react-ui";
import "@openuidev/react-ui/components.css";
import "@openuidev/react-ui/styles/index.css";

const prompt = openuiLibrary.prompt(openuiPromptOptions);
```

Useful React UI exports:

- `openuiLibrary`: OpenUI's full built-in library for charts, tables, forms, cards, images, layout, and other app UI.
- `openuiChatLibrary`: OpenUI's chat-optimized built-in library with follow-ups, steps, and callouts.
- `AgentInterface`: full chat app shell with backend `llm` and optional `storage` channels.
- `fetchLLM`, `restStorage`, stream adapters, and message formats: self-hosted Agent Interface backend wiring.
- `FullScreen`, `Copilot`, `BottomTray`: prebuilt chat surfaces.
- `ThemeProvider`, `createTheme`: theming.
- `@openuidev/react-ui/components.css`: component-level CSS used by React UI components.
- `@openuidev/react-ui/styles/index.css`: default unlayered styles.
- `@openuidev/react-ui/layered/styles/index.css`: cascade-layered styles for easier CSS overrides.

## Theme Agent Interface

Map host-company design tokens into `AgentInterface` with a `ThemeProps` object. Prefer `lightTheme`/`darkTheme` with `createTheme`; the old `theme` prop on `ThemeProvider` is a deprecated alias for `lightTheme`.

Treat `createTheme()` tokens as installed-version-specific. In development it validates keys against the runtime's default theme keys; unknown keys are warned and ignored. Verify custom keys against installed `node_modules/@openuidev/react-ui`; if package source is unavailable, consult first-party GitHub source from `https://github.com/thesysdev/openui/tree/main/packages` rather than relying on type-only fields such as chart palette options.

```tsx
import { AgentInterface, createTheme, type ThemeProps } from "@openuidev/react-ui";

const companyChatTheme: ThemeProps = {
  lightTheme: createTheme({
    background: "oklch(0.98 0.01 250)",
    interactiveAccentDefault: "oklch(0.55 0.18 255)",
    chatUserResponseBg: "oklch(0.55 0.18 255)",
    chatUserResponseText: "oklch(0.99 0 0)",
    radiusM: "10px",
    fontBody: "Inter, system-ui, sans-serif",
  }),
  darkTheme: createTheme({
    background: "oklch(0.16 0.02 255)",
    interactiveAccentDefault: "oklch(0.72 0.14 255)",
    chatUserResponseBg: "oklch(0.72 0.14 255)",
    chatUserResponseText: "oklch(0.12 0.01 255)",
  }),
};

const starters = [
  { displayText: "Summarize pipeline", prompt: "Summarize the current sales pipeline." },
];

<AgentInterface
  llm={llm}
  theme={companyChatTheme}
  logoUrl="/brand/logo.svg"
  agentName="Acme Assistant"
  starters={starters}
  starterVariant="long"
/>;
```

Use `disableThemeProvider` only when the app already wraps the chatbot in a compatible OpenUI `ThemeProvider`; otherwise leave the built-in provider enabled.

## First-Party Sources

Use installed package code and first-party docs/source when useful. Use docs for conceptual guidance, workflows, and narrative API explanations. For exact exports, generated signatures, package behavior, and examples, prefer installed source files, package READMEs, generated prompts, generated CLI templates, and installed package `.d.ts` files. If sources conflict, trust the package or generated template actually being used; otherwise compare the GitHub source and hosted docs. Some paths exist only in newer releases; match docs/source to the user's installed or requested version.

Before relying on remote GitHub source, compare it against the task target: inspect the app's `package.json`/lockfile, run `npm view @openuidev/react-ui version` when using public `latest`, and check installed exports under `node_modules/@openuidev/*`. Remote source can differ from the installed package.
