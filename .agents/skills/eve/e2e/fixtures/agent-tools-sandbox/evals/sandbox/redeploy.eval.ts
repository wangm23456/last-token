// Sandbox semantics across deployment updates, driven entirely from inside
// the eval: the test body runs on the host with the fixture as cwd, so it
// can rebuild and redeploy the agent mid-test. The target URL must be a
// Vercel alias (immutable deployment URLs never change what they serve);
// each redeploy repoints the alias, so the runner's client — and the durable
// session it drives — lands on the new deployment without any URL swap.
//
// Deployment adoption is dispatch-dependent. Turn dispatch routes parked
// sessions' turns to the latest deployment only where the workflow world can
// resolve "latest" (production; branch-carrying previews). Branch-less CLI
// preview deploys — which is what this eval pushes — pin turn execution to
// the deployment that created the session (see shouldRouteToLatestDeployment
// in execution/workflow-runtime.ts). The timeline below asserts exactly the
// preview contract; the pinned-turn gate at t3 is a deliberate tripwire that
// must be flipped when dispatch gains preview latest-routing
// (https://github.com/vercel/eve/issues/582).
//
// Timeline under test:
//   t0  session A writes a file into its sandbox workspace
//   t1  push a deployment update that touches only agent instructions
//   t2  session A still reads the file: the parked session keeps working when
//       its messages route through the new deployment, and its sandbox
//       (keyed per durable session, not per deployment) is untouched
//   t1' push a deployment update that adds a skill — skills materialize into
//       the sandbox workspace resources, so the sandbox version hash rotates
//       for anything executing the new code
//   t3  session A still sees the file: its turns are pinned to the original
//       deployment on preview, so neither the new manifest nor the rotated
//       sandbox key applies to it
//   t4  a NEW session B adopts the new deployment: the added skill loads and
//       shapes the reply
//
// Requires EVE_E2E_REDEPLOY_ALIAS plus Vercel credentials and a linked
// fixture directory (the e2e-vercel workflow provides all three); skips
// everywhere else.
