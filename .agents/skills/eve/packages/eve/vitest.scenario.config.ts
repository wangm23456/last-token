/**
 * Tier 2 — Scenario tests.
 *
 * End-to-end behaviour checks that require real subprocesses, real HTTP
 * listeners, real compile/bundle pipelines, or real workflow on-disk state.
 * Scenario tests take seconds to run and frequently mutate
 * `process.cwd`/`process.env`, so each file runs in its own forked worker
 * process. Some scenarios also rebuild the workspace package, which clears
 * its shared `dist/` directory; files therefore run serially. Tests within a
 * single file still run sequentially.
 *
 * Nothing in this tier is expected to be hermetic. Keep the set small —
 * anything that can be expressed through the in-memory `AppHarness` belongs
 * in the integration tier instead.
