/**
 * Type declarations are copied verbatim from the installed
 * @ai-sdk/openai version. The previous hand-written stub declared only
 * `openai.tools.webSearch()`, hiding the full OpenAIProvider /
 * OpenAIResponsesLanguageModel / OpenAIChatLanguageModel surface
 * upstream actually exports. Copying upstream keeps eve's vendored
 * types in sync without hand-editing on every AI SDK bump.
 *
 * Rewrites:
 *
 * - `@ai-sdk/provider` → already vendored, re-route both the named and
 *   the `import * as _ai_sdk_provider` namespace import at the vendored
 *   copy.
 * - `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` → type-only vendored upstream declarations.
