# Contributing to eve

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide covers everything you need to get the repo running locally and land a change.

## Signed commits

This repository requires verified commit signatures on protected branches.

Before contributing, configure Git to sign your commits with a GitHub-verified
GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key. Unsigned commits will be rejected by repository rules
and need to be rewritten as signed commits before they can be merged.

If a pull request includes unsigned commits, re-sign the commits and force-push
the branch. Make sure the signing key is added to your GitHub account and that
your commits appear as `Verified`.

A `Signed-off-by` line in the commit message is not enough to satisfy this
requirement. A verified commit signature alone does not satisfy the DCO either;
commits need both.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24+** — see [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc) (`nvm use` or `fnm use`)
- **pnpm** — the version pinned in [`package.json`](./package.json) (`corepack enable` handles this automatically)

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel/eve.git
cd eve
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

The repo is a pnpm workspace orchestrated with [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com):

- [`packages/eve`](./packages/eve) — the framework and `eve` CLI
- [`packages/eve-scaffold`](./packages/eve-scaffold) / [`packages/eve-catalog`](./packages/eve-catalog) — internal (unpublished) scaffolding libraries
- [`apps/fixtures`](./apps/fixtures) — shared agent fixtures used by e2e tests, TUI smoke tests, local dev, and bundle analysis
- [`apps/frameworks`](./apps/frameworks) — framework integration apps for Next.js, Nuxt, and SvelteKit
- [`apps/templates`](./apps/templates) — source apps for generated templates
- [`docs`](./docs) — the published documentation content
- [`e2e/`](./e2e) — fixture-owned `eve eval` end-to-end tests

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs the `eve` package build in watch mode alongside the [`apps/fixtures/weather-agent`](./apps/fixtures/weather-agent) fixture on an OS-assigned available localhost port. The fixture prints the selected URL at startup.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm test               # unit + integration
pnpm test:unit          # unit tests
pnpm test:integration   # integration tests
pnpm test:scenario      # scenario tests (requires pnpm build first)
pnpm test:e2e           # fixture-owned eve eval suites
pnpm test:tui           # TUI smoke scripts (not e2e)
```

E2E tests are fixture-owned evals. Run them from the fixture directory:

```bash
cd e2e/fixtures/agent-basic-runtime
pnpm exec eve eval --strict
```

The fixture agents and judges run against real models (`openai/gpt-5.5`), so
the environment must provide the corresponding model-provider credentials.

Vercel e2e builds that same fixture directory with `VERCEL=1`, deploys the
fixture's prebuilt Vercel output, and runs evals against the immutable
deployment URL. All fixture deployments link to the same Vercel project id; the
shared project's Preview env must provide those same model-provider
credentials.

Do not commit fixture trees under `packages/eve/test/fixtures/` — scenario app content is defined inline as `ScenarioAppDescriptor` objects under `packages/eve/src/internal/testing/scenario-apps/` (CI enforces this).

## Linting and formatting

```bash
pnpm lint          # oxlint (auto-fixes)
pnpm fmt           # oxfmt (also runs on staged files via the pre-commit hook)
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript across the workspace
pnpm check:deps    # syncpack — dependency versions must stay in sync
pnpm guard:invariants  # mechanical code-invariant lints (run in CI)
pnpm docs:check    # docs frontmatter and nav validation
```

All of these run in CI, so running them locally before pushing saves a round trip.

## Documentation

User-facing docs live in [`docs/`](./docs) and are published with the `eve` npm package and rendered by the docs site in [`apps/docs`](./apps/docs). If your change alters public behavior, update the relevant doc in the same PR and run `pnpm docs:check`.

## Before opening a pull request

Every pull request must be tied to an issue. Before opening a PR, search the
existing issues, discussions, and pull requests so you do not duplicate active
work. If there is no existing issue, open one with the relevant template and
describe the problem, use case, or bug reproduction.

For changes to public APIs, agent behavior, compiler/runtime internals,
dependencies, generated artifacts, fixture contracts, or any non-trivial
implementation detail, wait for discussion on the issue before investing in the
implementation. The goal is to agree that the problem is real and that the
proposed direction fits eve before review shifts to code. Bug fixes should link
to an issue with a reproduction or failing test case so the problem remains
tracked even if a specific fix is not accepted.

To avoid PRs that are unlikely to be reviewed or merged:

- Do not send broad rewrites, style-only churn, formatting-only changes, or
  generated-output refreshes unless a maintainer asked for them.
- Do not bundle unrelated fixes or refactors into one PR. Split them so each PR
  has one reviewable purpose.
- Do not add runtime dependencies without prior agreement. Prefer eve-owned
  wrappers, vendored code, or generated artifacts, and remember that the `eve`
  package should keep runtime dependencies minimal.
- Do not change public behavior based only on a hypothetical use case. Include a
  concrete user story, reproduction, fixture, or test that shows the need.
- Do not claim an issue silently. Comment before starting work, and check the
  thread first in case someone else is already working on it.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`.
2. Link the issue where the change was discussed and agreed on.
3. Make your change, including tests and docs where relevant.
4. Sign off every commit with `git commit -s`.
5. If the change affects the published `eve` package, add a changeset:

   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```

6. Make sure `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` pass.
7. Open the PR with a clear description of the problem and solution.

Releases are managed with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) by the maintainers.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We do not require a CLA. Instead, all contributions are made under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](./DCO.txt), a lightweight, one-line
attestation that you have the right to submit your contribution under the
project's license. There is nothing to sign and no account to create.

Every commit must include a `Signed-off-by` line matching the commit author's
name and email:

```text
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
```

Add it automatically with:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

If you forget, amend the last commit:

```bash
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
```

To sign off a series of commits, rebase with `--signoff`:

```bash
git rebase --signoff main
```

The sign-off requirement applies to all contributors, including Vercel
employees. A required check blocks pull requests that contain commits without a
valid sign-off.
