`defineDynamic` resolves the model, tools, skills, and instructions at runtime from a session event instead of declaring them up front. Reach for it when the right capability isn't known until the session starts, because it hinges on who the caller is, what tenant they belong to, feature flags, or external data. The [tools](../tools), [skills](../skills), and [instructions](../instructions) guides each point here for their dynamic form.

## Dynamic models

The `model` field in `agent.ts` accepts `defineDynamic({ fallback, events })`.
Resolvers run at `session.started`, `turn.started`, or `step.started`
(precedence: step > turn > session > `fallback`); `null` leaves a scope unset
and failures degrade to the next scope. Prefer `session.started` — prompt
caches are per model, so switching mid-session re-ingests the conversation at
uncached prices. See
[agent configuration](../agent-config#choose-the-model-dynamically) for the
full contract.

`fallback` is model-only: the agent always needs exactly one model, and the
compiled fallback anchors build-time metadata. Tools, skills, and instructions
default by authoring a static entry (or returning `null`), so `fallback` on
their `defineDynamic` export is a build error.

## Dynamic tools

Pass `defineDynamic` an `events` object whose handlers return either a single `defineTool(...)`, a `Record<string, defineTool(...)>`, or `null` for no tools. Wrap every entry in `defineTool()`. The wrapper stamps them so their `execute` functions survive workflow step boundaries.

The example below builds one tool per warehouse table. A map return names each tool by its bare key, so the model sees `orders`, `users`, and so on.

```ts title="agent/tools/query.ts"
import { defineDynamic, defineTool } from "eve/tools";
import { z } from "zod";
import { listTables, runReadOnly } from "../lib/warehouse";

export default defineDynamic({
  events: {
    "session.started": async (_event, ctx) =>
      Object.fromEntries(
        (await listTables()).map((t) => [
          t.name,
          defineTool({
            description: `Query ${t.name}. Columns: ${t.columns.join(", ")}`,
            inputSchema: z.object({ sql: z.string() }),
            execute: ({ sql }) => runReadOnly(t.name, sql),
          }),
        ]),
      ),
  },
});
```

### `execute` must be an inline function

Write `execute` as an inline function expression, arrow, or method shorthand placed directly as the property value. The bundler transform does not detect `execute: myFn` or `execute: makeFn()`, so those tools work on the first step but do not survive replay (re-running a step after a crash or resume; see [Execution model & durability](../concepts/execution-model-and-durability)). On later steps the transform reconstructs each `execute` from its stored closure variables instead of re-running the resolver, which is why it has to be inline.

### Naming

| Return shape            | File                       | Tool name(s)      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| single `defineTool`     | `agent/tools/analytics.ts` | `analytics`       |
| map `{ export, query }` | `agent/tools/tenant.ts`    | `export`, `query` |

A single return produces one tool named after the file slug, identical to a static tool. A map names each entry by its **bare key** — there is no automatic slug prefix. If a bare name might collide, namespace the key yourself by including the prefix in the key (e.g. return `{ "tenant__export": … }` to get `tenant__export`).

### Conflicts

A dynamic tool or skill whose name matches an **authored** one **overrides** it — a per-caller resolver can replace a built-in by name. Two **dynamic** resolvers emitting the same name is a genuine ambiguity and throws; namespace one of the keys manually to resolve it.

### Events

| Event             | Resolver runs          | Tools available for             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `session.started` | Once per session       | Every model call in the session |
| `turn.started`    | Once per turn          | Every model call in the turn    |
| `step.started`    | Before each model call | That model call                 |

### Execution order

When a stream event fires, three things happen in order.

1. The channel adapter handler runs and the event is written to the durable stream.
2. Stream-event [hooks](./hooks) fire.
3. Dynamic tool resolvers subscribed to that event run and update the tool set.

The tool loop reads the current set right before each model call, so a mid-turn update is visible on the next call.

A single file can declare handlers for several events, and the most recently fired one owns that file's tool set. Re-resolve on `turn.started` to replace what `session.started` returned:

```ts title="agent/tools/catalog.ts"
import { defineDynamic, defineTool } from "eve/tools";
import { z } from "zod";
import { runReadOnly, searchCatalog } from "../lib/catalog";

export default defineDynamic({
  events: {
    "session.started": async (_event, ctx) => ({
      query: defineTool({
        description: "Run a read-only query.",
        inputSchema: z.object({ sql: z.string() }),
        execute: ({ sql }) => runReadOnly(sql),
      }),
    }),
    // On each turn, re-resolve. Replaces this file's session.started tools for later calls.
    "turn.started": async (_event, ctx) => ({
      search: defineTool({
        description: "Search the catalog.",
        inputSchema: z.object({ term: z.string() }),
        execute: ({ term }) => searchCatalog(term),
      }),
    }),
  },
});
```

Resolvers across files run concurrently.

## Dynamic skills

A dynamic skills file resolves which [skill](../skills) a caller can load, keyed on the principal. It resolves on `session.started` and `turn.started` only (`step.started` is reserved for dynamic tools). Read `ctx.session.auth` or channel metadata and return a `defineSkill(...)` (named after the file slug) or `null`:

```ts title="agent/skills/team_playbook.ts"
import { defineDynamic, defineSkill } from "eve/skills";
import { PLAYBOOKS } from "../lib/playbooks";

export default defineDynamic({
  events: {
    "session.started": (_event, ctx) => {
      const team = ctx.session.auth.current?.attributes.team;
      const markdown = team ? PLAYBOOKS[team] : undefined;
      return markdown ? defineSkill({ markdown }) : null;
    },
  },
});
```

The caller's team gets its own playbook advertised as a loadable skill; everyone else gets nothing.

Skills follow the same naming rule as tools: a single `defineSkill(...)` is named after the file slug, while a map names each entry by its bare key (namespace the key yourself if it might collide). A dynamic skill overrides a same-named authored one; two dynamic resolvers emitting the same name throws.

## Dynamic instructions

A dynamic instructions file resolves the per-session system prompt the same way, returning `defineInstructions(...)` built from the principal, tenant, or external data:

```ts title="agent/instructions/persona.ts"
import { defineDynamic, defineInstructions } from "eve/instructions";

export default defineDynamic({
  events: {
    "session.started": (_event, ctx) => {
      const plan = ctx.session.auth.current?.attributes.plan ?? "free";
      return defineInstructions({
        markdown: `The caller is on the ${plan} plan. Match the depth of your answers to it.`,
      });
    },
  },
});
```

Both resolve before the prompt is assembled, so the model sees the right instructions and skill set for whoever is calling, without that context reaching anyone else.
