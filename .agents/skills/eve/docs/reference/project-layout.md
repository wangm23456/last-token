description: "Authored slots under agent/ and the path-derived naming rule."
---

eve builds an agent by walking the filesystem under `agent/`. Each directory is an authored slot, and the slot a file lands in determines how eve loads it.

## Naming rule

Identity comes from the path. You never write a `name` or `id` field on a `define*` call.

| Path                                  | Resolves to           |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `agent/tools/get_weather.ts`          | tool `get_weather`    |
| `agent/connections/linear.ts`         | connection `linear`   |
| `agent/skills/summarize.md`           | skill `summarize`     |
| `agent/subagents/researcher/agent.ts` | subagent `researcher` |

The root agent takes its name from the enclosing `package.json` `name`, falling back to the app-root directory name when `package.json` has no `name`. A subagent takes its name from its directory.

## Recommended layout

```text
my-agent/
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── agent/
│   ├── agent.ts
│   ├── instructions.md
│   ├── instrumentation.ts
│   ├── channels/
│   ├── connections/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── skills/
│   ├── lib/
│   ├── sandbox/
│   ├── tools/
│   ├── schedules/
│   └── subagents/
└── evals/
```

Evals live in `evals/` at the app root, a sibling of `agent/`, not inside it. See [Evals](../evals/overview).

## Slot table

The Subagents column states whether a local subagent (`subagents/<id>/`) can author the slot. A declared subagent inherits nothing from the root; it discovers its own slots. See [Subagents](../subagents).

## What reaches the runtime sandbox

eve does not mount the whole tree. Authored workspace files land in the sandbox workspace:

- `agent/sandbox/workspace/**` → `/workspace/...` at session bootstrap

Skill files land outside the workspace, under `$HOME/.agents/skills/...`. If `$HOME` is unavailable, eve falls back to `/workspace/skills/...`. Packaged skill references such as `references/checklist.md` resolve relative to the directory containing that skill's `SKILL.md`.

Everything in `lib/` stays import-only source code and never reaches the workspace.

## Local subagent layout

A local subagent lives under `subagents/<id>/` and uses the same `agent.ts` shape as the root.

```text
agent/subagents/researcher/
├── agent.ts
├── instructions.md
├── connections/
├── hooks/
├── skills/
├── lib/
├── sandbox/
├── tools/
└── subagents/
```

Rules:

- `agent.ts` is required, and must declare a `description`. The parent reads it on the lowered subagent tool to decide when to delegate.
- `instructions.md` / `instructions.ts` is optional (unlike the root agent, where it is required).
- `connections/`, `hooks/`, `skills/`, `lib/`, `sandbox/`, and `tools/` are all supported, discovered from the subagent's own directory.
- `channels/` and `schedules/` are not supported inside local subagents.
- Nested subagents are supported.

## Flat layout

Supported when the app root is also the agent root:

```text
my-agent/
├── package.json
├── agent.ts
├── instructions.md
├── tools/
└── skills/
```

Prefer the nested layout. It keeps the app root separate from the authored surface.

## Why didn't eve discover my file?

Run `eve info`. It lists the discovered surface and prints discovery diagnostics. From there, check that the file sits in the right authored slot (per the slot table above) and that the root-vs-subagent boundary is valid. eve also writes inspectable artifacts under `.eve/`. See the debugging artifacts in [instrumentation.ts](../guides/instrumentation) and the [CLI](./cli) reference.

## What to read next

- [`agent.ts`](../agent-config): the runtime config at the root
- [Tools](../tools): the most common authored slot
- [TypeScript API](./typescript-api): the define\* helpers and where they import from
